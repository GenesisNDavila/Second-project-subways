	<h1>Do policies affect crime? Statistics show a trend in subway crimes for the last five years</h1>

<h2><em>The numbers obtained from the New York Police Department and other database also reflect that the ridership of the train decreased but the crime complaints persist</em></h2>

<p>On October 22, 2022, Mayor Eric Addams, Governor Kathy Hochul, and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTZAgk9ca_M">in a press conference</a>, a new plan to increase safety in the subways. This plan included an increase in the number of police officers on public transportation.</p>   

<p>During the press conference, Hochul addressed the importance of public safety for her administration and the city.

“Since my first days in the office, I said we need our subway system to truly work. It has to be on time, but most importantly, it has to be safe,” expressed Hochul.</p>

<p>This was the second attempt this year to reduce crime in subways. In February, Addams and Hochul published a <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/home/downloads/pdf/press-releases/2022/the-subway-safety-plan.pdf">subway safety plan</a> that included supporting people with mental health issues and calls for changes to State and Federal laws.</p>

<p>This administration has not been the only one trying to decrease subway crimes. In 2017, former Governor Andrew Cuomo declared <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/29/nyregion/cuomo-declares-a-state-of-emergency-for-the-subway.html">a state of emergency</a> and assigned $1 billion to attend to this issue. However, <strong>data from the New York Police Department shows that over the last five years, the biggest complaints about security in the subway station are the same and, even when the ridership decreased with the pandemic, the number of complaints have not changed.</strong></p>

<p>After the pandemic, subway ridership decreased. However, the crime numbers show another tendency.
